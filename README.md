# simple-crud-api
this is a simple  api that I made while learning backend dev, it can make basic crud requests in 2 database ,one is a simple object with a single attribute(username) ,another is a multi attribute object(exercise)

### using it

clone the repo
give the mongodb uri string in the .env file(from mongo db console)
give command npm install
give command npm start

U can test this  api on postmann or insomnia api testing app and further use it as a backend in yout app by making furtheer more tweeks in this api
